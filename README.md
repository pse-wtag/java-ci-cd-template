# java-cicd-template

Centralized CI/CD for Java / Spring Boot (Maven) services.

This repository is a **reusable GitHub Actions template**. Every pipeline stage is a
self-contained [reusable workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows)
(`on: workflow_call`), and they are all orchestrated by one master workflow. A consumer
repo makes a single call and gets build, lint, unit + integration tests, multi-layer
security scanning (SAST + secrets + dependency + image), SBOM generation, and **signed**
container publishing — on hardened, egress-controlled runners.

## Use it in your Spring Boot repo

Add **one** thin workflow to the downstream Java repo. It delegates everything to the
master pipeline:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml  (in your Spring Boot repo)
name: CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

# A reusable workflow can only use permissions the *caller* grants. Set these at the
# top level so the pipeline can tag, push to GHCR, upload CodeQL results, and — most
# importantly — mint an OIDC token for keyless image signing (id-token).
permissions:
  contents: write        # PR build tags
  packages: write        # push image to GHCR
  security-events: write # CodeQL SARIF upload
  id-token: write        # cosign keyless signing (REQUIRED — defaults to none)
  actions: read
  checks: write
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  pipeline:
    uses: pse-wtag/java-ci-cd-template/.github/workflows/master-maven-pipeline.yml@main
    secrets: inherit
    with:
      java-version: "25"
```

That's the whole integration. Everything below is driven from that one call.

> **Do not add a `concurrency:` block to your caller.** The master pipeline already
> groups by `${{ github.workflow }}-${{ github.ref }}` (PR runs cancel superseded runs;
> `main` runs always finish). If you must add one, give it a *different* group — otherwise
> the caller and the reusable workflow share a group and cancel each other.

> **`id-token: write` is not optional if you want signed images.** Unlike the other
> permissions it defaults to `none` even when the repo token is "read and write", so it
> must be granted explicitly. Without it, `docker-publish` still builds and pushes, but
> the cosign signing step fails.

### Consumer setup checklist

1. **Grant the permissions above** (especially `id-token: write`).
2. **Enable Code Scanning** (Settings → Security → Code scanning) so CodeQL runs — the
   stage self-skips cleanly when it's disabled.
3. **Add a Maven Dependabot config** to your repo (this template ships only the
   `github-actions` half). Drop this into `.github/dependabot.yml`:

   ```yaml
   version: 2
   updates:
     - package-ecosystem: maven
       directory: "/"
       schedule:
         interval: weekly
       open-pull-requests-limit: 10
     - package-ecosystem: github-actions
       directory: "/"
       schedule:
         interval: weekly
   ```

4. **Verify signatures on deploy** (or in an admission controller) with cosign:

   ```bash
   cosign verify ghcr.io/<org>/<repo>@<digest> \
     --certificate-identity-regexp "https://github.com/<org>/<repo>/.github/workflows/.+" \
     --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
   ```

> Forking into another org? Update the `uses:` path in the caller **and** the
> `pse-wtag/java-ci-cd-template/...@v0.0.3` composite-action references inside the reusable
> workflows to point at your fork.

## Pipeline flow

The master pipeline runs **three sequential stages** plus a final gate. Each stage is a
reusable workflow that **fans its jobs out in parallel** internally:

1. **`build`** runs first, alone.
2. When it passes, **`verify`** runs — its four jobs (lint, unit-tests,
   integration-tests, security) all start **at once**.
3. When *all* of verify passes, **`release`** runs — `tag` and `docker-publish` run
   **in parallel**; on a push to `main`, **`verify-image`** then re-checks the pushed
   image's cosign signature before the stage is allowed to succeed.
4. On a push to `main`, once `release` succeeds, **`auto-release`** cuts the version tag
   and GitHub Release. It `needs: release`, so a failed build/verify/release never
   produces a release. Skipped on pull requests.
5. **`build-gate`** waits on all stages and is the single required status check.

`auto-release` is orchestrated **inside** the master pipeline (gated on `release`) — it
is no longer a standalone `on: push` workflow, so a failing pipeline cannot trigger it.

> **The whole of stage 2 gates stage 3.** `release` does `needs: verify`, so *both* `tag`
> and `docker-publish` wait for **all four** verify jobs (lint included) to finish.
> `build-gate` does `needs: [build, verify, release, auto-release]` and fails the run if
> any of them failed or was cancelled (`auto-release` is skipped on PRs, which is not a
> failure).

### Flow by event

- **Pull request → `main`:** `build → { lint · unit · integration · security } →
  { tag · docker-build (no push) } → build-gate`. No image is pushed or signed.
- **Push → `main`:** `build → { lint · unit · integration · security } →
  docker-publish (image → GHCR, scanned + signed) → verify-image (cosign verify) →
  auto-release (tag + GitHub Release) → build-gate`. `tag` is skipped (PR-only), and
  `auto-release` runs only after `release` succeeds.

## The jobs

| # | Job | Workflow | Runs when | What it does |
|---|-----|----------|-----------|--------------|
| 1 | **build** | `build.yml` | always | Rejects tracked `.env` files, compiles & packages (`clean package -DskipTests`), submits the dependency graph on `push`. |
| 2 | **lint** | `lint.yml` | always | Verifies code formatting with Spotless (`spotless:check`). |
| 2 | **unit-tests** | `unit-tests.yml` | always | Runs `mvn test` and publishes a JUnit report. |
| 2 | **integration-tests** | `integration-tests.yml` | always | Optionally exposes curated `extra-secrets` (never `GITHUB_TOKEN`), runs `mvn verify -Dsurefire.skip=true`, publishes a JUnit report. |
| 2 | **security** | `security.yml` | always | Three parallel scanners — **CodeQL** SAST (`java-kotlin`, self-skips when Code Scanning is off), **Gitleaks** secret scan, and **Trivy** dependency (SCA) scan that fails on *fixable* HIGH/CRITICAL CVEs. The Trivy vulnerability DB is cached across runs (`actions/cache`). |
| 3 | **tag** | `tag.yml` | PR → `main` | Tags the PR build (`pr-<n>-run-<run>`) and prunes old PR tags (keeps the latest 4). |
| 3 | **docker-publish** | `docker.yml` | `push`, or same-repo PR (pushes only on `push`) | Builds an OCI image via Spring Boot Buildpacks, **Trivy-scans** it (fails on fixable HIGH/CRITICAL; vuln DB cached via `actions/cache`), emits a **CycloneDX SBOM** artifact, pushes to **GHCR**, **signs** the pushed image with cosign (keyless/OIDC), then prunes old images (keeps the latest 3). |
| 3 | **verify-image** | `release.yml` | push → `main` | Runs `cosign verify` against the exact **digest** `docker-publish` pushed and signed (not a mutable tag) — asserting a keyless signature whose certificate identity matches `signer-identity-regexp` and whose OIDC issuer is GitHub Actions. Fails the release stage if the signature is missing or untrusted. |
| 4 | **auto-release** | `auto-release.yml` | push → `main`, after `release` succeeds | Bumps a SemVer patch tag, creates a GitHub Release with notes, keeps the latest 10. Gated on `release`, so a failed pipeline never cuts a release. |
| 5 | **build-gate** | inline | `always()` | Fails the run if any of `build` / `verify` / `release` / `auto-release` failed or was cancelled. The single required status check. |

## Configuration

All inputs pass through `master-maven-pipeline.yml`. The most useful ones:

| Input | Default | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `java-version` | `"25"` | JDK version for every stage. |
| `cache-type` | `"maven"` | Dependency-manager cache key for `setup-java`. |
| `build-egress-policy` | `"block"` | Harden-Runner egress policy for build / verify (`block` = enforce allowlists, `audit` = log-only). |
| `release-egress-policy` | `"block"` | Separate Harden-Runner egress policy for the release phase (docker publish + image verify). Split out from build so the broader registry set that buildpacks reach can be tuned independently. |
| `*-allowed-endpoints` | see file | Per-stage egress allowlists (build / test / security / docker). |
| `extra-*-endpoints` | `""` | Append hosts without overriding the defaults (`extra-build-endpoints`, `extra-test-endpoints`, `extra-security-endpoints`, `extra-docker-endpoints`). |
| `signer-identity-regexp` | `""` | Certificate-identity regexp `verify-image` requires of the image's keyless cosign signature. Empty defaults to `^https://github.com/<owner>/` (any workflow under the repo owner). Set it to the specific signing-workflow path for a tighter trust boundary. |
| `test-args` | `""` | Extra args for integration tests (e.g. `-D` properties). |
| `spring-boot-args` | `""` | Extra args for the Spring Boot image build. |

> Egress hardening defaults to **`block`** — the allowlists are enforced. Watch the first
> run's harden-runner summary and append any denied host via the `extra-*-endpoints`
> inputs. Set `build-egress-policy: audit` to switch to log-only while you tune them.

### Secrets

The consumer passes secrets with `secrets: inherit`; the master pipeline forwards only
what each stage needs:

- **`CR_PAT`** — GHCR push / cleanup token, forwarded explicitly to `docker-publish`
  (falls back to `github.token` when unset). Not broadcast to other stages.
- **`extra-secrets`** — optional curated JSON object (`{"NAME":"value",...}`) exposed as
  env vars to the integration tests only. Pass just what a test needs against a real
  external system; prefer Testcontainers so tests need no secrets at all. **Never** pass
  `toJSON(secrets)`.

```

### Composite actions

- **`java-setup`** — installs the Temurin JDK (default **25**), enables Maven dependency
  caching, and injects tuned `MAVEN_OPTS` (G1GC, RAM %, string dedup, capped metaspace).
- **`ghcr-cleanup`** — applies a retention policy to GHCR images (keeps the latest 3) with
  a built-in 60s retry. The owning `account` type (`user` / `org`) is configurable.

### Local git hooks

Enable them once per clone — make the hooks executable, then point git at `.githook`:

```bash
chmod +x .githook/pre-commit .githook/pre-push
git config core.hooksPath .githook
```

- **`pre-commit`** — runs `gitleaks protect --staged` to block secrets before they commit.
- **`pre-push`** — when pushed commits touch `*.yml` / `*.yaml`, runs `actionlint` and
  `yamllint` so broken workflow definitions never reach GitHub.

All three tools degrade gracefully if missing (the hook warns and skips), but install them
for full protection:

```bash
# macOS / Linux (Homebrew)
brew install gitleaks actionlint yamllint

# Linux (native)
pip install yamllint
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest
# gitleaks: grab a binary from https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases

# Windows (Chocolatey)
choco install gitleaks actionlint
pip install yamllint   # not on Chocolatey
```

## Security posture

- **Hardened runners** — every job that executes real work runs `step-security/harden-runner`
  with a configurable egress policy and per-stage endpoint allowlists. Build/verify and
  release each carry their own policy (`build-egress-policy` / `release-egress-policy`), both
  defaulting to `block`.
- **Pinned actions** — third-party actions are pinned to full commit SHAs; Dependabot
  keeps them current weekly.
- **Secret scanning** — Gitleaks in CI (`security.yml`) *and* locally (`pre-commit`).
- **Static analysis (SAST)** — CodeQL for `java-kotlin`.
- **Dependency scanning (SCA)** — Trivy flags known CVEs in declared/transitive deps;
  the build fails on fixable HIGH/CRITICAL (`ignore-unfixed` skips un-actionable ones).
- **Image scanning** — the built OCI image is Trivy-scanned before it ships, on PRs too.
- **Cached vuln DB** — both Trivy scans cache the vulnerability database via `actions/cache`
  (keyed per day, with a shared restore fallback) to cut scan time and avoid rate limits.
- **Supply-chain provenance** — a CycloneDX **SBOM** per build, uploaded as an artifact
  **and attested to the pushed digest** with cosign (`cosign attest --type cyclonedx`), so
  the SBOM is cryptographically bound to the image (`cosign verify-attestation` downstream).
  Pushed images are also **signed with cosign** using keyless OIDC (no long-lived keys).
- **Signature verification (verify-then-trust)** — on push to `main`, `verify-image` runs
  `cosign verify` against the exact **digest** that was pushed and signed (not the mutable
  tag), asserting a signature whose certificate identity matches `signer-identity-regexp`
  and whose issuer is GitHub Actions. A missing or untrusted signature fails the release.
  Downstream deploys should re-run the same check at admission time (see the consumer
  checklist) rather than trusting the tag alone.
- **`.env` guard** — the build fails if tracked `.env` files are detected.
- **Least privilege** — permissions are scoped per job, not globally; `docker-publish`
  receives only `CR_PAT`, not the whole secret store.
